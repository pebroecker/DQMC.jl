# DQMC.jl

This repository contains Julia code for DQMC simulations of interacting fermions on arbitary lattices. This code is under active development. All model specific code is found in the respective subfolders while generic DQMC routines are on the top level. Job files are saved in JSON format and output data is saved as HDF5 / JLD files.
